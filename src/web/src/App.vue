						A completely unique project that has no analogues. A unique algorithm that made it possible to get rid of halving and at the same time maintain
						a limit on the number of coins by burning 0.2% of digital dollars from all accounts every six months and 0.4% of digital shares every six months.

								<p>CITU combines internet security features to protect you from phishing attempts, malware-infected websites and other online threats. This provides an overall secure browsing experience.</p>

								<p>
									Our goal is to provide a fully integrated solution covering malware protection, cloud services, internet security, driver scanning and updating, key and password storage, remote device access, secure encrypted wallet and system optimization - all in one place.
								</p>

								<p>

									CITU is based on the principles of cryptography, decentralization and consensus to ensure the reliability and decentralization of transactions.
                                    The vision of CITU is to provide the best decentralized system for this world, using the most advanced CITU methods to create the best privacy and security currency, eliminating the current issues of privacy, financial system monopoly and economic imbalance. All nodes have equal power and control; no node has more influence than other nodes, namely the main nodes. Currencies are not created, maintained or represented by any person or company (i.e. central authority).

                            How will this system deal with high volatility?
                            The burning of coins every six months will help to reduce the volatility of the currency. This is because it will create a built-in incentive for people to spend their money rather than hoard it. If people know that their money will be worth less in the future, they will be more likely to spend it now. This will help to keep the currency circulating and prevent it from becoming too volatile.
                            How will this system deal with inflation?
                            The limited supply of coins will help to prevent inflation. The total number of coins will never grow above 20 billion digital dollars and 10 billion digital shares. This means that the value of each coin will be relatively stable over time.
                            How will this system deal with stagflation?
                            Stagflation is a combination of high inflation and high unemployment. The burning of coins will help to prevent stagflation by stimulating economic activity. When people spend their money, they are more likely to buy goods and services from businesses. This will create jobs and help to reduce unemployment.
                            How will this system deal with a deflationary spiral?
                            A deflationary spiral is a situation where prices are falling and people are reluctant to spend money because they expect prices to fall even further. The burning of coins will help to prevent a deflationary spiral by creating an incentive for people to spend their money. If people know that their money will be worth less in the future, they will be more likely to spend it now. This will help to keep prices from falling and prevent a deflationary spiral.
                            How will this coin help save money and increase the wealth of the owners of this coin?
                            The burning of coins will help people to save money. This is because people will be less likely to hoard money if they know that it will be worth less in the future. Instead, they will be more likely to invest their money or spend it on goods and services. This will help to increase the wealth of the owners of this coin.
                            In addition, the limited supply of coins will help to increase the value of each coin. This is because there will be a finite number of coins available, but the demand for coins may increase over time. This could lead to an increase in the value of each coin, which would benefit the owners of this coin.
                            Overall, this system has the potential to address a number of economic problems, such as high volatility, inflation, stagflation, and deflationary spirals. It could also help people to save money and increase their wealth.

					CITU aims to reduce or eliminate existing privacy issues with bitcoin and other privacy coins used in the market through a bug-free implementation of Zerocoin. Anyone can view the public wallet, not only the wallet balance, but also the amount received and paid (including the sender and recipient addresses of the public wallets). CITU
                    By implementing a minting script that gives users the freedom to remain anonymous or not, users can decide the degree of anonymity in a secure and decentralized manner. The mint and spend feature alone is CITU when needed.
                    inherently provides anonymity, and is not open to viewing everything through a public registry, as is currently the case.
