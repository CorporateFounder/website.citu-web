            4. Enter your decisions in the enter the law fields, for example, blogging for this organization. Or financing the site, etc. you can write down the address where you can transfer money, example: rDqx8hhZRzNm6xxvL1GL5aWyYoQRKVdjEHqDo5PY2nbM
            5. then click submite law
            6. The decision can be approved by the board of directors, but only the Judges can veto it. How decisions are made, it is necessary for the board of directors to give a vote of 57% or more and the judges either no one voted, or those who voted FOR will be more against. Each director's vote is equal to the percentage of his rating relative to other elected directors. Example, 600 YES and 400 NO voted for you, your rating is 200. Now letâ€™s imagine that in total all 7 directors received a rating of 2000. Then your vote is 10%.
            7. With a judge, everything is much simpler, one judge, one vote.
            Thus, the vote of directors voting directors: 0.0000000000000000, the vote of judges votesCorporateCouncilOfReferees raiting: 0, the vote of voters staking votes raiting: 0.0000000000000000. For the decision to be approved, voting directors must be equal to or greater than 57%, and votesCorporateCouncilOfReferees raiting must be equal to or greater than zero:
