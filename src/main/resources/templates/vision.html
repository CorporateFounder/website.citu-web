      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <p>complete CITU development plan for 10, 20, 30 and 40 years. This plan takes the organization's ambitious goals and breaks them down into more realistic steps.</p>

      <p>Our coin was created to solve these problems.
          Our algorithm, due to the fact that we use a point system that includes pow and pos,
          makes the currency less volatile. Why is our coin less volatile:
          pow mechanism: increases the value of the coin, since the higher the costs, that is, the cost
          the higher the market price, which increases confidence and demand for our coin.
          pos mechanism: where each next point costs twice as much, and the first point costs 10 coins,
          distributes coins more evenly among large miners. Also, if suddenly
          coins appear on the market at a lower cost, then it is more profitable for players to become
          buy up these coins if these coins are sold below market value or below cost.
          After all, to mine coins, you also need other coins and a lot of hash rate.
          In turn, how come all participants know that the miners will need
          these coins, they themselves buy these coins in advance and this creates artificial demand, which
          prevents our coin from depreciating and makes the exchange rate smoother.</p>
