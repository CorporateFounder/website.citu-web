You can also vote for other network members, both FOR and AGAINST. You can also remove your voice. Elections: Each network member can vote for a candidate. Each participant has three ways to vote FOR, AGAINST or WITHDRAW VOTE. The vote of a network participant is equal to the amount of staking on his account. That is, if you have 100 coins reserved, you can vote for several candidates, and if you vote AGAINST (NO), then the candidate receives minus 100, if FOR (YES) plus 100. As a result, for each candidate his YES-NO rating is calculated, Thus, seven candidates for the Board of Directors, and the 7 highest ranked candidates for the Council of Corporate Judges are in office. Each network participant can change their vote at any time. Only votes cast in the last two years are counted. Board of Directors: Can approve network decisions, for example, can create a project by approving a decision where participants will voluntarily send money to an approved address.

But director A has a rating of 40, that is, his share is 20% Therefore, for a resolution to be adopted, the resolution must receive a vote of 57% or more from the Directors. If the director has a very high rating, then he can make decisions alone; if he has a low rating, then he will have to get the support of other directors. Similarly, the Board of Directors elects the General Director. Council of Corporate Judges: The Board of Corporate Judges is elected in the same way as the Board of Directors, but it performs several functions 1. Resolves disputes that arise between network participants, creating a precedent. 2. May veto a decision of the Board of Directors if this decision contradicts the Charter or other current decisions. Each Judge has one vote, each Judge can vote YES, NO or abstain, as well as remove their previous vote. For each decision, the votes of the judges are calculated using the following formula: YES - NO. If the number falls below 0, then the decision is VETOed.

Board of Directors (7 participants): Can approve decisions for the network, such as creating projects and raising funds for their implementation. Approves decisions by a majority vote, where the weight of the director's vote depends on his rating relative to other directors. Elects the General Director.

Can veto decisions of the Board of Directors if they contradict the Charter or other current decisions. Each judge has one vote, decisions are made by majority vote (YES - NO > 0).

It should be noted that one person can hold several elected positions at the same time, for example, be a member of the Board of Directors and the Council of Corporate Judges.
